We provide an integration with popular payment gateways like Stripe, Braintree, PayPal etc.,. You may easily connect your gateway account with Chargebee and you’re ready to process transactions.\r\n\r\n###How to use Chargebee?\r\n\r\nAs an early stage Company, you may choose to configure the features present in Chargebee and get rolling immediately. As Chargebee has a powerful API, a lot of businesses start with a hosted page integration and later on transition to a full fledged API integration.\r\n\r\n###Alright, so why the open source initiative?\r\n\r\nOur customers are global, diverse (SaaS, eCommerce & Services) and come across interesting use cases faster than us. We constantly incorporate these use cases to improve our product. Some features are prioritized over others based on the number of requests, bandwidth etc.\r\n\r\nA fast growing startup has it’s own will. It requires feature enhancements that goes over & beyond standard features. The feature should not only be specific to the business but also be executed ASAP (like yesterday!). When implemented, it can play a pivotal role in taking the business to new heights or in simply making things a lot easier. \r\n\r\nWe wanted to step out of the way, give you the power and flexibility to include any features you like and let you take full control. Thus came about the open source initiative. \r\n\r\n###Here are the projects we’ve open sourced so far:\r\n\r\n###Customer Portal\r\n\r\nCustomize our open source version of the Customer Portal to suit your growing business needs.\r\n\r\n###Ruby Gem\r\n\r\nIntegrate Chargebee onto your sample application faster using the Open Source Ruby Gem.\r\n\r\n###Laravel Chargebee Package\r\n\r\nFast track your subscription implementation using the laravel framework and bundle.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
